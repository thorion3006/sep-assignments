1. An algorithm that has O(1) is a quantum computer whereas an algorithm with O(2^n) is an abacus.

2. In a binary search the best case scenario happens when the query item is found in the middle of the array.

3. In binary search the worst case scenario happens when the query item is present in either ends of the array.

4. The bounded case scenario is when the query item is present in an index other than the middle or the ends of the array.

6. Infinity

7. O(nln(n))

8.  def linear_iteration(n)
      N = 0
      n.times { N += 1 }
      puts N
    end

9. O(log n)

10. Big-omega(1)

11. Bi-theta(log n)
